PYTHON PRACTICE README FILE
Chance Muscarella

This repo hold example and practice scripts I'm making using Python to improve my skills in data analysis and visualization. 

I will link to any tutorials I am following where possible, and am trying to stick in VSCode, but sometimes need to use Jupyter Lab instead.

This is just for fun, so expect poor/messy code. Polished examples will be hosted in a separate repo.
